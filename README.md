## NB

- If you need to compile a lot of `.c` files or you have includes some personal `.h` file. Then just put all the program files in to the `./code` folder.

# Need your help

Need your test case, if you have one. Please feel free to ‘fork’ and upload your test cases. **DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR SOURCE CODE!!!**

# How to change it?

I'm using `c++` writing it.  After download, you can see the `selfEvaluation.cpp` file right? Feel free to change the code if you need and you want. Then compile it.
