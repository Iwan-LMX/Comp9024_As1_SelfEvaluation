# How to use it?

## For windows users:
1. Download this .zip file and unzip it. Remove all the files inside `./inputs` and `./code`
2. Put your code files under the `./code` folder. Includes all your `tripView.c` and every other `PQueue.c`, `PQueue.h` you used.
3. Double click `selfEvaluation.exe` 
4. If you passed, then congratulations.
   
## For mac users:
- Please use this `selfEvaluation_forMac.cpp`, and make sure you are using c++11 over more. 
1. Download this .zip file and unzip it. Remove all the files inside `./inputs` and `./code`
2. Put your code files under the `./code` folder. Includes all your `tripView.c` and every other `PQueue.c`, `PQueue.h` you used.
3. Using your ide comile this `selfEvaluation_forMac.cpp` and run it. E.G. compile like this `g++ -std=c++17 -o selfEvaluation selfEvaluation_forMac.cpp`, if there are other problem, you might need change the `\\` in the path to `/`.
4. If you passed, then congratulations.
(Sorry, I'm not good at macos, seems no other good way sames on windows)

## NB

- If you need to compile a lot of `.c` files or you have includes some personal `.h` file. Then just put all the program files in to the `./code` folder.

# Need your help

Need your test case, if you have one. Please feel free to ‘fork’ and upload your test cases. **DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR SOURCE CODE!!!**

# How to change it?

I'm using `c++` writing it.  After download, you can see the `selfEvaluation.cpp` file right? Feel free to change the code if you need and you want. Then compile it.

## Last
Thanks for [@Mingchen](https://github.com/Maka314), last time his self evaluation program inspired and impressed me a lot. As well as [@Ziting](https://github.com/Lztmeow) for provides most of the test cases and results.
